An easy, clean and simple way to enhance your site with code snippets.

== Description ==

**‚úÇ Code Snippets** provides an effortless way to enhance your WordPress site.

**üöÄ Upgrade to Code Snippets Pro** for complete CSS, JavaScript, Gutenberg, Elementor and cloud synchronisation integrations. **[Elevate your snippets experience now!](https://codesnippets.pro/pricing)**

Say goodbye to the hassle of tweaking your theme's `functions.php` file and downloading endless plugins ‚Äì Code Snippets simplifies the process!

A snippet is like a mini-plugin for your WordPress site, providing added functionality without the clutter.

Unlike other solutions that involve dumping code into your `functions.php` file, Code Snippets offers an intuitive graphical interface for seamless integration and real-time execution. Managing snippets is as easy as activating and deactivating plugins, only without the bloat and overhead.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

A full list of our Frequently Asked Questions can be found at [help.codesnippets.pro](https://help.codesnippets.pro/collection/3-faq).

= How can I recover my site if it is crashed by a buggy snippet? =
You can recover your site by enabling the Code Snippets safe mode feature. Instructions for how to turn it on are available here: <https://help.codesnippets.pro/article/12-safe-mode>.

= Will I lose my snippets if I change the theme or upgrade WordPress? =
No, the snippets are stored in the WordPress database, independent of the theme and unaffected by WordPress upgrades.

= Can the plugin be completely uninstalled? =
If you enable the 'Complete Uninstall' option on the plugin settings page, Code Snippets will clean up all of its data when deleted through the WordPress 'Plugins' menu. This includes all stored snippets. If you would like to preserve the snippets, ensure they are exported first.

= Can I copy snippets that I have created to another WordPress site? =
Yes! You can individually export a single snippet using the link below the snippet name on the 'Manage Snippets' page or bulk export multiple snippets using the 'Bulk Actions' feature. Snippets can later be imported using the 'Import Snippets' page by uploading the export file.

= Can I export my snippets to PHP for a site where I'm not using the Code Snippets plugin? =
Yes. Click the checkboxes next to the snippets you want to export, and then choose **Export to PHP** from the Bulk Actions menu and click Apply. The generated PHP file will contain the exported snippets' code, as well as their name and description in comments.

= Can I run network-wide snippets on a multisite installation? =
You can run snippets across an entire multisite network by **Network Activating** Code Snippets through the Network Dashboard. You can also activate Code Snippets just on the main site, and then individually on other sites of your choice.

= Where are the snippets stored in my WordPress database? =
Snippets are stored in the `wp_snippets` table in the WordPress database. The table name may differ depending on what your table prefix is set to.

= Where can I go for help or suggest new features? =
You can get help with Code Snippets, report bugs or errors, and suggest new features and improvements either on the [WordPress Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/code-snippets) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/codesnippetspro/code-snippets).

= How can I help contribute to the development of the Code Snippets plugin? =
The best way to do this is to fork the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/codesnippetspro/code-snippets) and send a pull request.

= How can I report security bugs found in this plugin? =
You can report security bugs found in the source code of this plugin through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/code-snippets). The Patchstack team will assist with verification, triage, and notification of security vulnerabilities.
